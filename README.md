# API_practice

A very basic project to practice and test various apis.

This is just to get used to apis to add them in future projects.

APIs used:
-NASA (Astronomical Picture of The Day) - How this project started, just wanted to try out NASA's API

-Dog Facts - Found a public api with random dog facts

-Number facts - Small little website that had random facts for any number. Could choose from trivia, date, year or math

-YeYe quotes - ....silly little website with quotes from the controversial rapper YeYe (f.k.a. Ye a.k.a Kanye West)

-Random Duck Image - Does exactly what it says

-PoetryDB - The latest and longest API code as of writing. Good website with a decently sized database of poets and their poems
